## Versions' History
I start this project on 26th February 2019. The very first "version" of the game is just a timer (version v01). You can see how I progress in making this little game from versions to versions (v01 to v39, the first playable version).

v39 - completed on 3rd June 2019, released on GitHub on 9th June 2020. The 1st official playable game release.
